# Arrays in Java

Arrays are very similar to lists in java, however these are typically immutable (or unchangeable). The way to declare them is very simple. Unlike having to use two lines for the mutable lists we did with `ArrayList` we can accomplish an array using one line. Let's look at the line below.

```java
int[] my_array = {0, 1, 2, 3};
```
Just like one might see in C++, we have to declare what data types will be contained within the array. You might also notice that the way to declare the elements in the array is very similar: we use brackets as well!
